    desc_one: "Kenyan corruption genesis was the Ndegwa Commission ,which allowed civil servants to engage in business .The commision was ignorant of the conflict iof interest ,the monster they were innocently creating .The commision intended to uplift their lives but in a negative way.Immortality started in the early 1980s after masharti allegations .The powers that were went to a notch-higher and started replacing civil servants with their tribesmen without prior for qualifications or experience.",

    desc_two: "Greed has sored in our public and private officers ,which has sore to heights of corruption we see today .The style of governance adapted since attainment of indepence and trends adopted where leaders are lifted higher than gods and glorified is the root cause.The middle class who are public servants perpetually resort to higher level of corruption to accumulate wealth and power as politicians invoke racial and ethnic sentiments to stay in power.All Current Kenyan politicians and public servants who have served ten plus years are recyled matter that cannot escape the blame of the woes we are in .They must be pushed out through the next ballot and your government should never appoint them in any office .The next government of the new generation should clean up the house by getting rid of such matter and making sure the country is under the rule of law.",
    title_three: "How to eradicate corruption",
    desc_three: "Let the country be propelled simply by the rule of law.The appointments should be as directed by the constitution .I do vouch that the country does not lack quality .Picking people to head public offices just because they are friends or are politically correct is archaic and an abuse of authority .Cast vote to change motherland into haven for all.The choice is yours-individually.Do not allow selfish and carefree leaders throw our country to the dogs because that is where it is heading .",

    desc_one: "During our ancestors life ,a child was around the family all day long no longer feasible.They survived on caltivation of land and rearing animals on vast pasture land which they assumed was theirs until the white man arrived and just pushed them out .Livestock keeping was their main activity and heritage .Their lives were dependent on cattle;names ,songs ,wars ,food and wealth were about cattle. ",
    title_two: "Colonial era",
    desc_two: "When the white man arrived in kenya,he came with him his ways of living and traditions,education was largely a big part of it .Industrial Age had flourished in the west while our ancestors were still lagging behind with the agrarian age with domesticated animals and scratching the ground with odd implements to work on the land for crops .The jobs were in the urban  areas ,hence employment migratedd to the mushrooming cities and towns whre factories were coming up ,leaving their families in the rural areas .It has not being easy to adapt to this change culturally .We have always being reminded that being educated meant preferring the best not only to the worst but also to the second best .It was hammered that the best gift of a parent to a child is education and upbringing for when people are free to do as they please ,they only imitate each other .The theme was to train a child in the ways of doing and when he/she has grown will not depart from it .Taking children to school was compulsorily enforced through the government administration officials .None escaped the purge because the industrialist needed trained artisans and laborers urgently or their upcoming factories  ",
    title_three: "Sample ",
    desc_three: "All these trends influenced the progress of education. One of the most significant results was the gradual acceptance of the view that education ought to be the responsibility of the state. Some countries, such as France and Germany, were inspired by a mixture of national aspiration and ideology to begin the establishment of public educational systems early in the 19th century. Others, such as Great Britain and the United States, under the spell of laissez-faire, hesitated longer before allowing the government to intervene in educational affairs. The school reformers in these countries had to combat the prevailing notion that “free schools” were to be provided only for pauper children, if at all; and they had to convince society that general taxation upon the whole community was the only adequate way to provide education for all the children of all the people. The new social and economic changes also called upon the schools, public and private, to broaden their aims and curricula. Schools were expected not only to promote literacy, mental discipline, and good moral character but also to help prepare children for citizenship, for jobs, and for individual development and success. Although teaching methods remained oriented toward textbook memorizing and strict discipline, a more sympathetic attitude toward children began to appear. As the numbers of pupils grew rapidly, individual methods of “hearing recitations” by children began to give way to group methods. The monitorial system, also called the Lancastrian system, became popular because, in the effort to overcome the shortage of teachers during the quick expansion of education, it enabled one teacher to use older children to act as monitors in teaching specific lessons to younger children in groups. Similarly, the practice of dividing children into grades or classes according to their ages a practice that began in 18th century German,was to spread everywhere as schools grew larger.",
